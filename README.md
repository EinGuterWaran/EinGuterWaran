### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Janusan Lingeswaran but just call me **Janu**. Welcome on my Github profile!
- :mortar_board: &nbsp; I'm a creative, inquisitive **computer science student at RWTH Aachen University** in Germany.
- :seedling: &nbsp; Iâ€™m currently learning the MERN stack.
- :trophy: &nbsp; In my free time, I like to participate in hackathons. If you know of an interesting hackathon and are looking for a team partner, feel free to contact me via email.

Besides being a **working student** at **KÃ¼chenheld**, I am currently working on the following projects and ideas:

- :revolving_hearts: :globe_with_meridians: &nbsp; Dating apps for ethnic diasporas and the special needs of them
- :book: :iphone: &nbsp; An app for bookworms, authors and those who want to become one in the guise of a social media platform
- :computer: :soccer: &nbsp; Web scraping + data analysis, especially in soccer
- :video_game: :muscle: &nbsp; Gamification in the area of learning + fitness

I am also working on other exciting projects which I will add here as soon as they become more concrete.
