## 👋 Hi! I'm Janu, a product-minded developer turned entrepreneur based in Germany. 🇩🇪

I'm the founder of [FeatherFlow](http://feather-flow.com/), where we build first working products (MVPs) for startup founders and help them get off the ground.

I share what I do and know on [Twitter/X](https://twitter.com/JanuBuilds).
