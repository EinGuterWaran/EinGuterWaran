### :wave: Hi there, I'm Janu from Germany!

#### :computer: About Me
I'm deeply passionate about Tech Entrepreneurship and Product Development. I regularly share my insights on these topics on my [Twitter/X](https://twitter.com/JanuBuilds) and in my newsletter, ["The Future of Digital Products"](https://digitalfuture.beehiiv.com/subscribe).

#### :wrench: Professional Services
As a freelancer, I offer a variety of software services, including automation software, web development and AI centred software.

Additionally, I'm part of FeatherFlow ([visit our website](http://feather-flow.com/)), where we specialize in MVP Fullstack software development. Our goal is to help you build your MVP to effectively test the market.

#### :briefcase: Current Role
I'm also an **Implementation Consultant** at [e-dynamics](https://www.e-dynamics.de/), where I specialize in web analytics consulting. I work with big companies like C&A and Alltours, helping them optimize their online presence and digital strategies.

#### :handshake: Volunteering and Community Engagement
I'm committed to giving back to the community. As a volunteer course instructor with [IT4Kids](https://it-for-kids.org/vision), I teach children about digitalization through graphical programming at Aachen elementary schools. This weekly engagement allows me to share my passion for technology with the next generation.
