# Hi, I’m Janu. I love building Software Products.

Focused on entrepreneurship and software product development.

## What I Do
- I breathe life into ideas, turning concepts into market-ready products.
- I share what I know on [Twitter/X](https://twitter.com/JanuBuilds) and through my newsletter ["Build Profitable Software Products"](https://digitalfuture.beehiiv.com/subscribe).

## Giving Back
I volunteer with [IT4Kids](https://it-for-kids.org/vision) because I love teaching kids about tech:

- I teach weekly classes at elementary schools in Aachen.
